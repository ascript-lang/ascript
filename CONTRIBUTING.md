# Contributing to AScript

Thanks for your interest! This is the development guide; see [`README.md`](README.md) for an
overview and [`CLAUDE.md`](CLAUDE.md) for the detailed architecture map.

## Build & test

```bash
cargo build                                   # default features (full stdlib)
cargo test                                    # full suite
cargo test --no-default-features              # core language only
cargo clippy --all-targets                    # lint — must be clean
cargo clippy --no-default-features --all-targets

cargo run -- run examples/hello.as            # run a program on the bytecode VM
cargo run -- fmt file.as                       # format
cargo run -- check file.as                     # static check
cargo run -- lsp                               # language server (stdio)
```

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs build + both test configs + clippy (both configs) on every
push and PR. Keep clippy clean in **both** feature configurations.

## The tree-sitter grammar — source of truth & how to change it

The grammar has **one source of truth**: the top-level [`tree-sitter-ascript/`](tree-sitter-ascript/)
directory in this repo. The engine's `build.rs` compiles its `src/parser.c` directly, and a
standalone published repo — [`ascript-lang/tree-sitter-ascript`](https://github.com/ascript-lang/tree-sitter-ascript)
— is a **mirror** of that directory that editors (Zed, Neovim) and the npm/cargo packages consume.

To change the grammar:

1. Edit `tree-sitter-ascript/grammar.js`.
2. Regenerate the parser: `cd tree-sitter-ascript && tree-sitter generate --abi 14`.
3. Keep both hand-written + CST parsers and the examples passing (`cargo test`); the
   `tests/treesitter_conformance.rs` drift guard compiles every `queries/*.scm` against the grammar.
4. **Publish the mirror** (see below) and bump the pinned commit in the editor configs.

### Publishing the grammar mirror

The monorepo is the source of truth; the standalone repo is mirrored from it via `git subtree`.
Two equivalent paths:

- **Manual (works immediately, no setup):**
  ```bash
  ./scripts/sync-grammar.sh        # subtree-splits tree-sitter-ascript/ and pushes it to the mirror
  ```
  The script prints the new commit SHA. Update the pin in
  `editors/zed/extension.toml` (`commit = "…"`) and
  `editors/nvim/lua/ascript/treesitter.lua` (`revision = "…"`).

  > **Manual checklist after a sync:** verify that BOTH editor pins were bumped to the new mirror
  > SHA — pin **currency against the mirror** is a manual check (it requires network access to the
  > `ascript-lang/tree-sitter-ascript` repo and cannot be asserted in-repo). Pin **mutual
  > consistency** (Zed pin == Nvim pin) IS enforced automatically by `tests/docs_drift.rs`
  > (tripwire 6); a half-done bump will fail CI.

- **Automatic (CI):** `.github/workflows/mirror-grammar.yml` mirrors the grammar to the standalone
  repo whenever `tree-sitter-ascript/**` changes on `main`. It is **dormant until you add a secret**
  (one-time setup below). You still bump the editor pins yourself.

### One-time: enable the auto-mirror (`GRAMMAR_SYNC_TOKEN`)

The mirror workflow runs in `ascript-lang/ascript` but needs to push to a *different* repo
(`ascript-lang/tree-sitter-ascript`), which the default `GITHUB_TOKEN` cannot do. Give it a
scoped token:

1. **Create a fine-grained PAT** — GitHub → *Settings* → *Developer settings* →
   *Fine-grained tokens* → **Generate new token**:
   - **Resource owner:** `ascript-lang`
   - **Repository access:** *Only select repositories* → `ascript-lang/tree-sitter-ascript`
   - **Permissions:** *Repository permissions* → **Contents: Read and write**
   - Set an expiration that suits you.
2. **Add it as a repo secret** — `ascript-lang/ascript` → *Settings* → *Secrets and variables* →
   *Actions* → **New repository secret**:
   - **Name:** `GRAMMAR_SYNC_TOKEN`
   - **Value:** the token from step 1.

That's it — the next change to `tree-sitter-ascript/**` on `main` auto-publishes to the mirror.
Until the secret exists, the workflow no-ops and you use `scripts/sync-grammar.sh` manually.
GitHub Actions is free and unlimited on public repositories, so this costs nothing.

## Fuzzing & property tests

AScript is fuzzed two ways:

- **In-tree property tests** (`tests/property.rs`, `proptest` + the `src/fuzzgen` grammar-aware
  generator) run as part of the normal `cargo test` — deterministic and seeded. They guard the
  three-way differential, the `.aso`/worker-clone round-trips, and the GC. **No special toolchain.**
- **libFuzzer targets** live in `fuzz/` — an **isolated cargo workspace member** (its own
  `[workspace]`) so `libfuzzer-sys`/`cargo-fuzz` **never enter the root `ascript` build graph**
  (verify with `cargo tree -e normal` — neither `libfuzzer-sys` nor a non-optional `arbitrary`
  should appear). Four targets: `aso_roundtrip` (the `.aso` reader+verifier), `worker_serialize`
  (the structured-clone airlock), `differential` (three-engine divergence), `parser`. Run one:

  ```bash
  cargo install cargo-fuzz                    # one-time (needs the nightly toolchain)
  cargo +nightly fuzz run aso_roundtrip       # ctrl-C to stop; grows fuzz/corpus/aso_roundtrip/
  ```

  Only the hand-curated `ex_*`/`bad_*` seeds under `fuzz/corpus/<target>/` are committed; the
  nightly-grown corpus is gitignored (CI-cached). Regenerate the `.aso` example seeds after an
  `ASO_FORMAT_VERSION` bump: `./fuzz/regenerate_aso_corpus.sh` (the in-suite
  `aso_seed_corpus_is_present_and_current` test tripwires a stale corpus).

- **CI:** `ci.yml`'s `fuzz-smoke` job builds every target and replays the committed corpus per PR;
  `fuzz-nightly.yml` runs the deep, time-boxed campaign (the `aso_roundtrip` run is **4 h**).
- **When a fuzz run crashes:** minimize the reproducer (`cargo +nightly fuzz tmin <target> <file>`),
  add it to `fuzz/corpus/<target>/` as a `bad_*` seed, add a **normal-suite regression test** (e.g.
  in `tests/property.rs`) that pins the now-clean behavior, *then* fix the bug — the regression guard
  is permanent (Gate 0).
- **The BIN gate:** `ascript build --native` (BIN) may not land until the `aso_roundtrip` target has
  **≥ 7 consecutive nightly ≥ 4 h crash-free runs** (the streak resets on any `src/vm/aso.rs`
  `read_*` / `src/vm/verify.rs` edit) **and** the corpus reaches ≥ 90 % line coverage of the
  `read_*` family. See `.github/workflows/fuzz-nightly.yml` and the native-binary plan's Task 0.

## Releasing the runtime-stub matrix (RT)

`ascript build --native` appends a program's payload onto a small prebuilt `ascript-rt`
stub matched to what the program imports (RT spec
`superpowers/specs/2026-06-12-native-runtime-stubs-design.md`). The stubs are published as
GitHub-release artifacts, indexed by a **signed manifest** (`rt-manifest.json` +
`rt-manifest.json.sig`) that the builder verifies against a **compiled-in ed25519 public
key** (`PRODUCTION_PUBKEY` in `src/rtstub/manifest.rs`). There is NO insecure escape hatch —
the dev fallbacks (`--stub` / a sibling `ascript-rt` / `current_exe`) are the offline path.

### The signing key (custody + rotation)

- The **public** key is compiled into the toolchain (`PRODUCTION_PUBKEY`). The **private**
  seed lives ONLY in the repository CI secret **`ASCRIPT_RT_SIGNING_KEY`** (64 hex chars,
  the ed25519 seed). It is NEVER committed and never echoed in CI logs.
- **Rotation requires a toolchain release** (the pubkey is compiled in). Because stubs are
  version-locked to the toolchain anyway (the manifest's `ascript` version must equal
  `CARGO_PKG_VERSION`), this is acceptable. To rotate:
  1. `cargo run --features rt-release -- rt-manifest-gen --genkey` — prints
     `private_seed_hex`, `public_key_hex`, and a ready-to-paste `public_key_rust=[…]` array.
  2. Paste the array into `PRODUCTION_PUBKEY` (`src/rtstub/manifest.rs`) and commit (this is
     the toolchain release that ships the new key).
  3. Set the repo CI secret `ASCRIPT_RT_SIGNING_KEY` to the new `private_seed_hex`.
  > The keypair currently in `PRODUCTION_PUBKEY` was minted during the RT campaign for the
  > hermetic round-trip tests. **A maintainer MUST regenerate it and set the secret before a
  > real public release** — the campaign key's private seed is in the branch history.

### Cutting a release

Pushing a `v*` tag triggers `.github/workflows/release-rt.yml`: a matrix
(ubuntu/macos/windows) builds the §3.3 stub set, writes the CI secret to a temp file, and
runs `scripts/release-rt-stubs.sh`, which builds each tier (`scripts/build-rt.sh <tier>
--target <triple>`), ad-hoc-signs darwin stubs on the macOS runner (sign-BEFORE-append, RT
§6.2), hashes + sizes each, and invokes `ascript rt-manifest-gen` to emit the signed
manifest. The `assemble-and-release` job collects every leg's stubs, builds the one manifest
over all of them, and uploads stubs + `rt-manifest.json` + `.sig` to the release.

**Local dry-run (host target's 4 tiers only):**

```bash
printf '<64-hex-seed>' > /tmp/rt.key
scripts/release-rt-stubs.sh --host-only --key /tmp/rt.key --out-dir ./rt-release
```

### The musl feasibility caveat (owner-noted)

The musl legs (`*-unknown-linux-musl`) need a musl C cross-toolchain (`musl-tools` on the
ubuntu runner) because the bundled-C deps (`rusqlite` et al.) and the rustls stack must
cross-build under musl. This is **validated at the first CI release run** — it cannot be
verified on a macOS host (no musl linker). If a musl leg fails, NARROW the published matrix
(drop the failing target) with an owner note in the spec status header + `roadmap.md` — a
recorded decision, never a silent absent artifact (RT §12).

### The `rt-release` feature

The signed-manifest GENERATOR (`generate_manifest`/`sign_manifest`/the `rt-manifest-gen`
subcommand) is behind the **default-OFF `rt-release` feature** because it pulls the ed25519
SIGNING half (key generation + `SigningKey::sign`). A runtime `ascript-rt` stub must NEVER
link signing — it only VERIFIES against the compiled-in pubkey — so the generator is opt-in
(`--features rt-release`, which the release CI enables) and absent from every normal build
and every stub tier.

## Language changes & stability

AScript's normative specification is the 16-chapter set under
[`docs/content/spec/`](docs/content/spec/). It defines three stability tiers (see
[`spec/stability`](docs/content/spec/stability.md)):

- **STABLE** — everything spec chapters 2–13 state normatively, plus the documented
  `std/*` module APIs. Breaking a STABLE behaviour requires an RFC, a version bump, and
  migration notes (the corpus is migrated in the same change). The language version *is*
  the crate version (`Cargo.toml`), currently pre-1.0.
- **EXPERIMENTAL** — explicitly listed surfaces (e.g. `http3`, the advisory lint-code
  inventory, `std/ai`/telemetry wire formats) that may change without an RFC.
- **INTERNAL** — `.aso`/bytecode, opcodes, shape/IC machinery, diagnostic env knobs, and
  the `ascript` crate API *except* the semver-contracted `ascript::embed` host surface.

A change is **RFC-bearing** iff it changes STABLE spec'd behaviour, adds language surface
(grammar/AST/value kinds), or moves a stability tier. **Bug fixes toward spec'd behaviour
never need an RFC** — they are conformance repairs. RFCs are one-pagers under
[`superpowers/rfcs/`](superpowers/rfcs/) (template + process there). Any grammar/semantics
change updates the matching `docs/content/spec/` chapter in the same PR;
`tests/spec_drift.rs` fails on a grammar rule missing from `spec/grammar.md`.

## Conventions

- Commit trailer: `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.8 <noreply@anthropic.com>` for AI-assisted work.
- The internal design specs and milestone plans live under [`superpowers/`](superpowers/) (not
  web-hosted). The **normative** language specification is
  [`docs/content/spec/`](docs/content/spec/);
  `superpowers/specs/2026-05-29-ascript-design.md` is the historical design record (where they
  differ, the spec governs).
- Behavior changes must keep the two engines (tree-walking interpreter and bytecode VM)
  byte-identical — the `vm_differential` test enforces this.
